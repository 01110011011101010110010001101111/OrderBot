# OrderBot
Meet OrderBot, a food preparation manipulation robot! This is part of my final project robotics manipulation ([6.421](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/Fall2023/)). It is a full-stack system that is able to parse an order and prepare meals, inspired by CSAIL's BakeBot. 

With this project, I got to cover a ton of ground, exploring natural language processing, computer vision, simulation, and kinematics. I also got to develop my communication skills and explored a ton of different things that didn't get integrated into the final pipeline like mobile manipulation and reinforcement learning. 

The stack currently uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [PyDrake](https://drake.mit.edu/).

I will clean up this repository, but most of the code currently is in `dev/order_to_robot.py`. Feel free to reach out for the most up-to-date CNN model as well!
